# Looking for Gamers (LFG)

__NOTE__: Since Parse was taking down in February 2017, this app does not work anymore and is not on the app store

## App Description

Spend more time playing, and less time finding people.
Connect with other players who want to do exactly the same thing as you! 

Looking for Gamers lets you make posts for various games allowing you to be explored quickly, and easily. It also allows you to find other people who want to do the same activity as you. It is very easy to make a post, and also filter through them. Get started now!

If you do not see a Game that you are looking for, simply send me an email using the "Feedback" button in the app. This app is designed in a way so that it is very easy to add new Games.
